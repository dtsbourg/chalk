  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
      I study robots and their brains at EPFL in Switzerland. I was recently an intern
      on the LHCb experiment at CERN, and am currently completing my
      master thesis at the SNAP laboratory in Stanford. I'm trying to
      optimize my research interests, so feel free to help update my gradients
      by getting in touch!
